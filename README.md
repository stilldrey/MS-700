# MS-700
Additional Materials, Presentations and Demos for MS-700

Most Microsoft courses have approximately 3 modules per day of class. The MS-700 course has six modules for a four day course. There is obviously PLENTY to talk about for 4 days when you have a topic as wide as Microsoft Teams, but if you don't have a Linux virtual machine (or macOS at your disposal), it might be harder to share some of the detials from these Teams clients or the admin settings for Teams hardware. I plan to upload examples from either my hardware or others that have helped me with Teams Rooms, Surface Hub, Teams phones, etc.
